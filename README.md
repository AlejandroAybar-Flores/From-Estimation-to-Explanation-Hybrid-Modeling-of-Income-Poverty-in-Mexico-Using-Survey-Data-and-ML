# From-Estimation-to-Explanation-Hybrid-Modeling-of-Income-Poverty-in-Mexico-Using-Survey-Data-and-ML

#Despite significant macroeconomic advances, poverty remains a deeply entrenched and multidimensional issue in Mexico. Using nationally representative household data from ENIGH 2022, this study develops a two-stage framework to analyze and predict income poverty by combining traditional statistical analysis with advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In the first stage, a survey-weighted logistic regression model identifies structural factors associated with poverty across demographic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic variables. The findings indicate the relevance of household consumption, family size, food insecurity, education, occupation, and regional differences. The second stage evaluates the predictive performance of various ML and DL models in classifying households by poverty status. Among these, the 1D-CNN achieves the highest accuracy (78.7\%) and AUROC (85.4\%), capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data. Moreover, Shapley values are used to interpret model predictions, confirming the importance of relevant variables and identifying the mechanisms behind poverty classification. By integrating statistical inference, predictive modeling, and interpretability tools, the study offers a comprehensive approach to poverty assessment. The findings emphasize persistent structural and regional gaps, offering a practical framework for use in similar survey-based settings. The implementation and code supporting this analysis are publicly available at
