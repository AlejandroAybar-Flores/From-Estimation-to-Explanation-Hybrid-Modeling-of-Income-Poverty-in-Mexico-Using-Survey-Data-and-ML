# From-Estimation-to-Explanation-Hybrid-Modeling-of-Income-Poverty-in-Mexico-Using-Survey-Data-and-ML

Despite significant economic advances, poverty remains a multidimensional issue in Mexico. Using data from ENIGH 2022, this study develops a two-stage framework to analyze and predict income poverty by combining traditional statistical analysis with machine learn- ing (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In the first stage, a survey- weighted logistic regression model identifies factors associated with poverty across demographic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic variables. The findings indicate the relevance of household consumption, family size, food insecurity, education, occupation, and regional differences. The sec- ond stage evaluates the predictive performance of ML and DL models in classifying households by poverty status. Among these, the 1D-CNN achieves the highest accuracy (78.7%) and AUROC (85.4%), capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data. Moreover, Shapley val- ues are used to interpret model predictions, confirming the importance of relevant variables and identifying the mechanisms behind poverty classi- fication. By integrating statistical inference, predictive modeling, and in- terpretability tools, the study offers a comprehensive approach to poverty assessment. The findings emphasize persistent structural gaps, offering a practical framework for use in similar survey-based settings.
